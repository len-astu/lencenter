Comprehensive Project Management Page Specification
Objective
Design and develop a centralized project management page for our company website. This page will serve as a hub for task assignment, progress tracking, and overall project management. It aims to facilitate efficient collaboration among the CEO, co-founders, and managers by providing clear task visualization, communication tools, and performance analytics.

Key Requirements
1. Task Assignment and Management
Task Creation & Assignment:

Allow the CEO (or authorized users) to create tasks and assign them to specific co-founders or managers.
Fields to include:
Task Title: A short, descriptive title.
Description: A detailed explanation of the task.
Assignee: A dropdown or search field to select the responsible person.
Due Date: A date-picker to set the deadline.
Priority Level: Options such as Low, Medium, High, or Critical.
Status: Options include To Do, In Progress, Completed, On Hold.
To Do List Format: Visualize tasks in a “To Do” list with clear differentiation based on priority and due dates.
Additional Task Features:

Comments: Allow users to add threaded comments to each task.
File Attachments: Enable uploading of relevant documents or images.
Task Dependencies: Implement a system where certain tasks (e.g., Task B) cannot commence until prerequisite tasks (e.g., Task A) are completed.
2. Progress Tracking and Visualization
Visual Representations:

Kanban Board: Provide columns for each task status (To Do, In Progress, Completed, On Hold) for drag-and-drop management.
Progress Bars: Show individual task progress and overall project completion.
Gantt Chart/Timeline: For project-level scheduling, visualize task dependencies, start/end dates, and milestones.
Calendar View: Display task deadlines and milestones in a monthly/weekly calendar format.
Status Updates:

Enable users to update task status in real time.
Record and display historical changes (audit trail) for accountability.
Reports and Summaries:

Generate project-level progress reports, including metrics such as task completion rate, overdue tasks, and team performance.
Allow custom report generation and data export (CSV, PDF).
3. Project Management Features
Multi-Project Support:

Enable creation and management of multiple projects, each with its own set of tasks.
Group tasks within individual projects for better organization.
Project Dashboards:

Provide high-level dashboards with key performance indicators (KPIs), such as overall progress, pending tasks, and critical deadlines.
Include summary views, charts, and metrics that allow quick assessment of project health.
Team Management:

Allow project managers to create and manage project teams.
Provide tools for assigning roles within projects and monitoring team performance.
4. User Roles and Permissions
Role Definition:
CEO: Full access to all projects and tasks, including creation, modification, and deletion.
Co-founders: Access to manage specific projects and tasks; may have administrative privileges over selected areas.
Managers: Ability to manage tasks within assigned projects; limited to creating, updating, and tracking tasks.
Access Control:
Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that only authorized users can create, assign, or modify tasks and projects.
Protect sensitive project information with appropriate permission levels.
5. User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX)
Intuitive Navigation:

Design a clean, user-friendly interface with clear menus and navigation paths.
Use visual cues (e.g., color coding for task status and priority) for quick identification.
Responsiveness:

Ensure the page is fully responsive across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
Optimize the layout for touch input on mobile devices.
Notification System:

Implement in-app notifications and alerts for task assignments, updates, approaching deadlines, and new comments.
Provide an overview of recent activity on the project dashboard.
Design Consistency:

Use a consistent color scheme, typography, and spacing aligned with the overall company branding.
Ensure all interactive elements are clearly indicated (e.g., hover states, active states).
6. Technical Considerations
Technologies and Frameworks:

Frontend: Consider using modern JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js for a dynamic UI.
Backend: Node.js with Express or Python with Django/Flask for API development.
Database: Use a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) or a NoSQL solution (e.g., MongoDB) for storing tasks, projects, and user data.
Real-time Updates: Consider WebSockets or libraries like Socket.io for real-time task updates and notifications.
Security:

Implement authentication (e.g., JWT, OAuth) and authorization measures to protect user data.
Ensure secure file upload handling and data encryption for sensitive information.
API Integrations:

Integrate with external calendar systems (Google Calendar, Outlook) for syncing task deadlines.
Consider integrations with communication platforms (Slack, Microsoft Teams) for real-time collaboration notifications.
7. Reporting and Analytics
Built-in Reporting Tools:

Provide dashboards that display task completion rates, project progress, and user performance metrics.
Enable custom report generation and allow data export (CSV, PDF formats).
Data Visualization:

Utilize charts and graphs to illustrate trends, progress, and areas needing attention.
Implement drill-down features for detailed analysis.
8. Communication and Collaboration
Commenting System:

Include a comment section within each task and project for ongoing discussions.
Support threaded comments and mention functionality to alert specific team members.
In-App Notifications:

Deliver notifications for task assignments, updates, comments, and approaching deadlines.
Optionally, integrate with email or messaging platforms for additional alerting.
