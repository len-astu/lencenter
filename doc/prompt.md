Create a Comprehensive Project Management Page for Our Company Website**

**Objective:** Design a detailed prompt to guide the development of a new project management page on our company website. This page will serve as a central hub for task assignment, progress tracking, and overall project management, facilitating efficient collaboration between the CEO, co-founders, and managers.

**Key Requirements:**

1.  **Task Assignment and Management:**
    * Enable the CEO to create and assign tasks to specific co-founders and managers.
    * Include fields for task title, description, assignee, due date, priority level, and status (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Completed, On Hold).
    * Implement a "To Do" list format for clear task visualization.
    * Allow for the addition of comments and file attachments to tasks.
    * Implement a system for task dependencies (e.g., task B cannot start until task A is completed).

2.  **Progress Tracking and Visualization:**
    * Provide a clear visual representation of task progress, such as progress bars or Kanban boards.
    * Allow users to update task status and track changes over time.
    * Generate project-level progress reports and summaries.
    * Implement a calendar view for visualizing task deadlines and project milestones.

3.  **Project Management Features:**
    * Enable the creation and management of multiple projects.
    * Allow for the grouping of tasks within projects.
    * Implement project timelines and Gantt chart functionality.
    * Provide project-level dashboards with key metrics and performance indicators.
    * Allow project managers to create and manage project teams.

4.  **User Roles and Permissions:**
    * Define clear user roles (CEO, co-founder, manager) with specific permissions.
    * Ensure that only authorized users can create, assign, and modify tasks and projects.
    * Implement role-based access control for sensitive project information.

5.  **User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX):**
    * Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface for easy navigation and task management.
    * Ensure the page is responsive and accessible on all devices (desktop, mobile, tablet).
    * Use clear and concise language throughout the page.
    * Implement a notification system to alert users of task assignments, updates, and deadlines.

6.  **Technical Considerations:**
    * Specify the technologies and frameworks to be used for development.
    * Outline the database requirements for storing task and project data.
    * Address security considerations for protecting sensitive project information.
    * Consider API integrations with other company tools (e.g., calendar, communication platforms).

7.  **Reporting and Analytics:**
    * Provide reporting features to track task completion rates, project progress, and user performance.
    * Allow for the generation of custom reports and data exports.

8.  **Communication and Collaboration:**
    * Include a comment section for each task and project to facilitate communication.
    * Implement in-app notifications for task updates and project changes.

**Deliverable:** A detailed specification document outlining the requirements and design for the project management page, including wireframes and user flow diagrams."
